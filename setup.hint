ldesc: "Irc with many features: vi-like editor line and general usage,
comfortable backscroll buffers with regex search mechanism in multiple
screen regions, multiple pages that contain window regions, nickname
completion, etc. TIRC doesn't have a scripting language. It is the
author's belief that scripting languages do more harm by abuse than
they're useful"
